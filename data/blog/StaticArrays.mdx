##  Remove Duplicates from sorted Array

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`. To get accepted, you need to do the following:

1. Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially.
2. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important, as well as the size of `nums`.
3. Return `k`.

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,1,2]`  
**Output:** `2, nums = [1,2,_]`  
**Explanation:** Your function should return `k = 2`, with the first two elements of `nums` being `1` and `2` respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]`  
**Output:** `5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]`  
**Explanation:** Your function should return `k = 5`, with the first five elements of `nums` being `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` respectively. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned `k` (hence they are underscores).
 

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        // Use a Set to store unique elements as Set only allows unique values, That was my first thought on this problem
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Then we add all the elements of array to Set , so that only unique elements remain
        for(int num : nums) {
            set.add(num);
        }
        
        // using a for loop and a post-increment op resize the current nums array with the size of elements in set and copy elements back to array
        int i = 0;
        for(int n : set) {
            nums[i++] = n;
        }
        
        // Finally sort using the Arrays.sort() method. 
        Arrays.sort(nums, 0, set.size());
        
        // to return the number of unique elements we return the size of the set
        return set.size();
    }
}
